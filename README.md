# Star Wars Film Selector

My Python assignment for the CFG Degree.

A Python console app which helps you choose which Star Wars film to watch based on which characters you want to see. If you don't add Luke Skywalker, it'll ask you if you want to. After you've finished choosing characters it gives you a list of the films which they're all in together and writes this info to a file.
- First time building something with Python.
- First time using an API.
